# Instaclustr's .NET Utilities for Apache Kafka<sup>TM</sup>

This project contains a number of components:
* A published library called `Instaclustr.Kafka`, which contains shared utility classes which simplify and operationalise the usage of Kafka in .NET applications. This library is an **Unsupported Tool**, and falls outside the scope of Instaclustr support agreements and SLAs.
* A series of samples until the `examples` folder that demonstrate the use of the above library in various integration scenarios. These examples are classed as **Samples**, and so falls outside the scope of Instaclustr support agreements and SLAs.
